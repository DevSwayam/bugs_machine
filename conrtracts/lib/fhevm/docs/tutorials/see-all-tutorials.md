### Code examples in GitHub

- [ERC-20](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm/blob/main/examples/EncryptedERC20.sol): A variation of the standard ERC20 smart contract that incorporates encrypted balances, providing additional privacy for token holders. -
- [Darkpool](https://github.com/omurovec/fhe-darkpools): A smart contract that enables anonymous trading of cryptocurrencies or assets, typically used to execute large orders without affecting the market price.\[by [Owen Murovec](https://github.com/omurovec)]
- [Cipherbomb](https://github.com/immortal-tofu/cipherbomb): A Hardhat-based template for developing Solidity smart contracts, with sensible defaults. - by Clément Danjou \[by Clément Danjou]
- [Battleship](https://github.com/battleship-fhevm/battleship-hardhat): A smart contract that replicates the classic Battleship game on a blockchain in a transparent manner. \[by [Owen Murovec](https://github.com/omurovec)]
- [Governor DAO](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm/tree/main/examples/Governor): A DAO smart contract that facilitates governance decisions through encrypted voting
- [Blind Auction](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm/blob/main/examples/BlindAuction.sol): A smart contract for conducting blind auctions where bids are encrypted and the winning bid remains private.
